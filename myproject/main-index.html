A year later, at a conference in Copenhagen, the idea of an annual Women’s Day took off, and by 1911, over a million people across Europe joined in. 🎉 Fast forward to 1917, women in Russia led protests that changed history, and by 1975, the United Nations made it official.", color: "#98FB98" }, // Pale Green
